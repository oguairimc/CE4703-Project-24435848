INTRO:

The aim of this assignment was to design and implement a modular C program that demonstrates the use of arrays, modular design, preprocessor directives and statistics.
The program performs the following:
	* Generates and manipulates arrays using random or user-inputted values
	* Sorts, clears, and randomizes arrays
	* Calculates statistical values such as minimum, maximum, average, median, variance, and standard deviation
	* Displays results through a menu that continuously executes until the user exits.
The projects consists of C modules with .c and .h pairs, using 15 Working Functions (WF) and 3 Menu Functions (MF). 
The main program ties these modules together through a user interface implemented in main.c
The design makes use of modular programming principles, uses Doxygen commenting to document automatically, and uses preprocessor macros for sentinal value and code reuse



PROGRAM STRUCTURE:

1) random_utils.c / random_utils.h
Provides random number generation used throught the program 
	* WF1_getRandom

2) array_utils.c / array_utils.h
Contains functions to fill, clear, sort, and randomize integer arrays
	* 

3) print_utils.c / print_utils.h

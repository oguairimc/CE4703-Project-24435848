INTRO:

The aim of this assignment was to design and implement a modular C program that demonstrates the use of arrays, modular design, preprocessor directives and statistics.
The program performs the following:
	* Generates and manipulates arrays using random or user-inputted values
	* Sorts, clears, and randomizes arrays
	* Calculates statistical values such as minimum, maximum, average, median, variance, and standard deviation
	* Displays results through a menu that continuously executes until the user exits.
The projects consists of C modules with .c and .h pairs, using 15 Working Functions (WF) and 3 Menu Functions (MF). 
The main program ties these modules together through a user interface implemented in main.c
The design makes use of modular programming principles, uses Doxygen commenting to document automatically, and uses preprocessor macros for sentinal value and code reuse



LIST OF MODULES:

1) random_utils.c / random_utils.h
Provides random number generation used throught the program 
	* WF1_getRandom()

2) array_utils.c / array_utils.h
Contains functions to fill, clear, sort, and randomize integer arrays
	* countUsed()
	* WF2_fillFromKeyboard()
	* WF3_fillRandom()
	* WF4_clearArray()
	* WF5_sortArray()
	* WF6_randomizeArray()

3) print_utils.c / print_utils.h
Provides formatted printing of arrays
	* WF7_printUsed()
	* WF8_printAll()

4) stats.c / stats.h
Performs statistical calculations on integer arrays
	* WF9_getMin()
	* WF10_getMax()
	* WF11_getAverage()
	* WF12_getMedian()
	* WF13_getVariance()
	* WF14_getStdDev()
	* WF15_countUsed()

5) menu.c / menu.h
Demonstrates the working functions through MF1, MF2, MF3
	* performMF1()
	* performMF2()
	* performMF3()

6) main.c
Entry point for the application, manages menu selection
	* main()

Each module is fully independent and communications only through public function calls
All arrays are passed as parameters. No global variable are used.



PREPROCCESSOR DIRECTIVES:

The following preprocessor directives are used:

* Include Guards
Every header file ised #ifndef, #define, and #endif to prevent multiple inclusions

* Simple Macro
#define UNUSED (-1) is used to mark unused array elements

* Parameterized Macro:
#define SWAP(a,b) do {int tmp = (a); (a) = (b); (b) = tmp;} while (0) is used to swap two integer values during sorting or randomization

These demonstrate both types if macros as required in the assignment sheet




LIST AND SPECIFICATION OF FUNCTIONS PER MODULE:

* random_utils.c / random_utils.h

The purpose of random_utils is to generate random number generation (WF1) used for filling arrays in array_utils.c

int WF1_getRandom(int lower, int upper);

* returns a random integer between lower and upper (inclusive)
* uses the C library rand() function
* srand() is called once in main() to seed the random generator


* array_utils.c / array_utils.h

The purpose of array_utils is to manipulate arrays used throughout the program (WF2-WF6)

WF2_fillFromKeyboard(int arr[], int capacity)
prompts the user to input integers until either the array is full or a negative number is entered. The rest of the array is filled with the sentinal UNUSED

WF3_fillRandom(int arr[], int size, int capacity, int min, int max) 
fills the array with size random integers in the range [min, max] and fills remaining elements with UNUSED

WF4_clearArray(int arr[], int capacity)
sets all elements in the array to UNUSED

WF5_sortArray(int arr[], int capacity)
sorts all used elements of the array in ascending order 

WF6_randomizeArray(int arr[], int capacity)
randomizes order of used elements 


* print_utils.c / print_utils.h
the purpose of print_utils is to display the arrays

WF7_printUsed(int arr[], int capacity)
prints only the used elements of the array (stops at the first UNUSED)

WF8_printAll(int arr[], int capacity)
prints all elements in the array, including UNUSED elements


* stats.c / stats.h
the purpose of stats is to perform statistical operations on arrays

WF9_getMin(int arr[], int capacity)
returns the smallest element in the array

WF10_getMax(int arr[], int capacity)
returns the largest element in the array

WF11_getAverage(int arr[], int capacity)
calaculates the average of the elements in the array

WF12_getMedian(int arr[], int capacity)
creates a temporary copy of the used portion of the array, sorts it, and returns the median value

WF13_getVariance(int arr[], int capacity)
calculates the variance of the array by adding the squared difference between each element and the average

WF14_getStdDev(int arr[], int capacity)
computes the standard deviation as the square root of the variance

WF15_countUsed(int arr[], int capacity)
returns the count of the used elements before the first UNUSED


* menu.c / menu.h
the purpose of menu is to implement the 3 Menu Functions which demonstrate the programs functionality

performMF1()
	* clears an array of 10 elements
	* fills it with 7 random value
	* prints the used and full arrays
	* clears it again and prints
	* fills it again with 5 random values, sorts and prints it
	* displays the minimum and maximum values

performMF2()
	* fills a 20 elements array with 15 randoms numbers (the sample output given had 20/20 elements in the array but the assignment sheet says to fill 15/20 so i did that)
	* prints, sorts, and prints again
	* randomizes and prints a third time
	
performMF3()
	* prompts user to enter positive integers
	* displays the array once input is complete
	* calculates and displays minimum, maximum, average, median, variance, and standard deviation



* main.c
the purpose of main is to implement a loop-driver text menu allowing the user to select MF1, MF2, MF3
it runs until option 4 is selected
